LittleORM was originally created, and still being developed under
'ORM' namespace. But it turned out this namespace was already taken
when I finally decided to put it on CPAN.

That is why LittleORM is known under 'LittleORM' on CPAN.

In this directory lies a separate source tree for CPAN distro only.
